# ChristCollegePythonChallenges
My Solution for the Christ College Python Challenges (currently 5 problems).

There will be comments at the top of each script with extra info or steps that were undertaken e.g. for the first python challenge, it was necessary to convert the polar form of Fermat's Spiral to parametric form on paper as I did not find the parametric form online 

There will also be comments detailing which target or extension goal was hit. For example, for the first, it will have T1, T2, T3 to correspond to the three Targets of the challenge. Similarly, for the extension problems E1, E2, E3. This is usually to mark out which sections of code pertain to which challenge target which is especially useful if target code has been disabled (using comments probably)
